# Raycasting First Person Game

This project is a simple first-person game that uses raycasting to render a 3D-like environment on the console. It's similar in style to classic games like Doom. This project is designed to help you learn the basics of game graphics and rendering techniques.


## Features

    -Player movement (forward, backward, left, right)
    -Player rotation (turning left and right)
    -Raycasting engine for rendering the 3D environment
    -Collision detection to prevent the player from walking through walls
    -Textured walls with shading based on distance
    -Textured floor and ceiling

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Before running this game, make sure you have:

    -C++ compiler (such as g++) installed
    -Windows operating system (for console-based graphics)

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
    
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-raycasting-game.git

```

Compile the code:

```bash
    
g++ main.cpp -o raycasting_game

```

Run the game:

```bash
    
./raycasting_game

```

## How to Play

    -Use W and S keys to move forward and backward.
    -Use A and D keys to turn left and right.
    -Explore the 3D environment and navigate through the maze.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the map variable in the code. The map represents the layout of the game world. You can create your own mazes by changing the map string.
Controls

    -Use W to move forward.
    -Use S to move backward.
    -Use A to turn left.
    -Use D to turn right.
    -Press Esc to exit the game.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the classic first-person shooter games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. It serves as an educational resource for learning about basic game graphics and raycasting techniques.
